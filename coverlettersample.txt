My expertise spans across Azure WebApps, Kubernetes orchestration, and infrastructure-as-code using Terraform. I have led cross-functional teams to migrate legacy applications to cloud-native architectures, resulting in 40% cost reduction and enhanced scalability.

What particularly excites me about this opportunity is your company's commitment to innovation and cutting-edge technology. I am passionate about implementing robust monitoring solutions and automating complex deployment processes. My experience with containerization, microservices architecture, and cloud security best practices aligns perfectly with your requirements.
