## 🤖 AI Integration

The application uses Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash model via a secure N8N backend:

- **Backend**: N8N workflow at `https://n8n.rifaterdemsahin.com/webhook/cover-letter-generator`
- **Model**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`
- **Temperature**: 0.7 (balanced creativity and consistency)
- **Max Tokens**: 2048 (sufficient for cover letter length)
- **Prompt Engineering**: Advanced prompts that analyze CV and job requirements
- **Quality Control**: Reference examples ensure consistent, professional output
- **Security**: API keys stored securely on the backend, not exposed to the frontend

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: Upload PDF CV and fill job specifications
2. **Content Extraction**: Extract text from uploaded CV (simulated in demo)
3. **API Call**: Frontend sends data to N8N backend endpoint
4. **AI Analysis**: N8N workflow calls Gemini 2.5 to analyze CV content and job requirements
5. **Generation**: AI creates personalized cover letter based on analysis
6. **Output**: Professional cover letter ready for use
